# Data-Visualization-JavaScript-
In this project I have visualized the Hershey data on candy sales for four states. I have used d3.js and dimple.js to create interactive visualizations for this data.

# Data
This data has been provided by the Hershey Chocolate company. The data contains the sales of candy stores during 15 consequetive saturdays (with football games), the sales difference between 2014 and the corresponding date in 2015 with different type of game (i.e. Home and Away), as well as the average of weekly sales in both years.

# Purpose 

The ultimate goal of this visualization is to discover this dataset to see how different market channels and states affect the sales. Also, we want to see if there is any difference between those weeks with home game (2015) and away game (2014) versus the opposite.

# Validation
To evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization, I first prepared two visualizations and I designed a survey on google forms to ask a number of respondents to provide suggestions that could improve their understanding of the patterns in the dataset. Three respondets provided suggestions and I changed the charts according to their opinions. Both charts have been provided in this write up.
